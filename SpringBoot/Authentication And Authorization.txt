Authentication:
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system making a request. It ensures that the requester is who they claim to be. In web applications and APIs, authentication commonly involves the use of credentials, such as usernames and passwords, tokens.


1) Basic Authentication: In basic authentication, the client includes a username and password in the request headers. While simple, it's not considered secure because credentials are sent in plaintext and can be intercepted.

2) Token-based Authentication: With token-based authentication, the client sends a token with each request after initially authenticating with a username and password. The server verifies the token's authenticity and grants access accordingly. Tokens can be JWTs (JSON Web Tokens), OAuth tokens, or other types of tokens.

3) OAuth: OAuth is an authorization framework that allows third-party services to access a user's resources without exposing their credentials. It's commonly used for delegated authorization, where a user grants a third-party application limited access to their resources.


Authorization is the process of determining whether a user or system has permission to access a particular resource or perform a specific action. Once a user is authenticated, authorization determines what they are allowed to do within the system.
